Include a section with styles. Apple Mail.app supports it, but Gmail and Hotmail do not, so it's a no-no. Hotmail will support a style section in the body but Gmail still doesn't.


Link to an external stylesheet. Not many email clients support this, best to just forget it.


Background-image / Background-position. Gmail is also the culprit on this one.


Clear your floats. Gmail again.
Margin. Yep, seriously, Hotmail ignores margins. Basically any CSS positioning at all doesn't work.
